My code uses a while statement with a != to keep looping the question and hints until the user provides the correct answer. After the correct answer is recieved the same pattern is repeated.

I put all my questions into variables so that it would be more flexible if I wanted to change the theme/questions of the game.

I've explained in my assignment submissions more on why I used the 'while' condition.
